The scripts in this folder were used once when the mp3 folder got a bit messy.
Multiple versions of the same songs, spaces in filenames, m4as which are less
playable.  I also prefer just to have lowercase filenames (its best to stick to
one convection to avoid e.g. multiple directorys for the same artist.  The ideal
order to run these would be:

1. m4a2mp3.py
2. tidy_artists.py
3. tidy_albums.py
4. tidy_tracks.py

remove_dirs_not_containing_mp3s.py looks a bit dangerous.
